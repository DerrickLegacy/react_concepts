React Router is a JavaScript library that helps us developers create single-page applications that are responsive and have a dynamic user interface. It is a popular tool among React developers and is used to create routing and navigation for web applications.

In this project I am using React Router V6.

React Router v6 is a complete rewrite of the previous versions. The biggest difference is that v6 is a static router and does not keep track of any state internally. This means that v6 is much simpler and easier to use than previous versions.

Another difference is that v6 uses a new URL parsing algorithm that is more compliant with the RFC standard. This means that v6 is more likely to work with other software that also uses RFC compliant URL parsing.


This project clearly show how to work with react router-dom from initial setup to all the routing related topics such as:

1. Rendering our first route to our First Pages
2. Page Components
3. Link Component and how to use it to avoid re-renders on entire page
4. Error Page handling to curb unknown route URLS
5. Navbar component
6. Nested Routes
7. Shared Layout
8. Index Pages
9. NavLink Component
10. URL Params
11. Single Product
12. useNavigate()
13. Protected Route
14. Refactor 

All the above was through a small tutorial course by the curtsey of Mr.John Smilga via the Free Code Camp Org youtube page.
